I built this from scratch.  This allows you to search for movies and tv shows accross multiple viewing platforms including Netflix, Amazon, Itunes, Hulu... and many more depending on your location and the country you live in also shows the restaurants in your area that are near you in a five mile radius.  I used Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript(Jquery/Ajax), API's.  A challenging part of this was getting the users zipcode instead of the city they are in but eventually I got it working.  I also used firebase to store the movies name(or tv show), the images(cover photo of the movie/show), and the platforms that stream them.  Feel free to try this out a couple of times but not to much because I have to pay 1 cent everytime you do.
